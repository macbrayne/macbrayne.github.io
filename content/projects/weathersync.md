A Minecraft mod developed for the [Modfest 1.20 "Sky and Sea"](https://modfest.net/1.20) event.
As I found it more fun to play with weather APIs than to actually implement gameplay it doesn't add any in-depth mechanics but it does allow you set your in-game weather
(not affecting the world) to the real-world weather of any location using the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) API.
It also includes an optional geo-ip lookup feature to automatically set the weather based on your IP address location.

Available for 1.20.
